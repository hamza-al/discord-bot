a = "There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style 'hunt and peck' and touch typing. For example, many 'hunt and peck' typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3-6 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers."
b = "The first personnel management department started at the National Cash Register Co. in 1900. The owner, John Henry Patterson, organized a personnel department to deal with grievances, discharges and safety, and training for supervisors on new laws and practices after several strikes and employee lockouts. During the 1970s, companies experienced globalization, deregulation, and rapid technological change which caused the major companies to enhance their strategic planning and focus on ways to promote organizational effectiveness. This resulted in developing more jobs and opportunities for people to show their skills which were directed to effective applying employees toward the fulfillment of individual, group, and organizational goals. Many years later the major/minor of human resource management was created at universities and colleges also known as business administration."
c = "Jim and Anne will be in charge of the spring field day to be held in early June. They will ask their friends' aid to get set up. There will be games for the boys and girls. The children will want to hike, ride their bikes, and swim. This yearly event will be held in the new Peach Grove Park. Ruth has work to do on the plans for food for the day. Last year Ruth spent most of her time helping the two cooks with many snacks. Hot dogs, fries, soft drinks, ice cream, and candy apples were big sellers. Apple pie and ice cream sold well too. I hope Ruth serves the same food this year. George Long will hire the band and singer for the day. A great jazz band will play. George's mom leads the group. The jazz band is sure to be one of the big hits. George is to have them play from one to four and also in the evening. The fine songs they will play are sure to please all of us. Nice gifts will be given to all of the winners in each of the events. Local news coverage will include television and newspapers. Joyce Scott will take care of the pictures for the school paper and yearbook. Maybe the national news will do a short story on the tenth annual spring field day."
d = "An ever-growing number of complex and rigid rules plus hard-to-cope-with regulations are now being legislated from state to state. Key federal regulations were formulated by the FDA, FTC, and the CPSC. Each of these federal agencies serves a specific mission. One example: Laws sponsored by the Office of the Fair Debt Collection Practices prevent an agency from purposefully harassing clients in serious debt. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act makes certain that protection from misleading packaging of goods is guaranteed to each buyer of goods carried in small shops as well as in large supermarkets. Products on the market must reveal the names of all ingredients on the label. Language must be in clear and precise terms that can be understood by everyone. This practice is very crucial for the lives of many people. It is prudent that we recall that the FDA specifically requires that all goods are pure, safe, and wholesome. The FDA states that all goods be produced under highly sanitary conditions. Drugs must be completely safe and must also be effective for their stated purpose. This policy applies to cosmetics that must be both safe and pure. Individuals are often totally unappreciative of the FDA's great dedication."
e = "Proofreader applicants are tested primarily on their spelling, speed, and skill in finding errors in the sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set."
f = "One morning my friend and I were thinking about how we could plan our summer break away from school. Driving from our own state to several nearby states would help to expand our limited funds. Inviting six other friends to accompany us would lower our car expenses. Stopping at certain sites would also help us stretch our truly limited travel budget. Yesterday I engaged in an interesting and enlightening discussion about finances. I found it difficult to imagine that during my lifetime I might well earn at least one-half million dollars. It is also possible that I might spend as much as one-half million during the same period. The really difficult thing for me to do will be to save more of the half-million than I spend. Thinking about today's high cost of living makes this seem an impossible task for most. Last week I asked a friend to talk with me and a girl-friend about college. Our friend is the Dean of Women at a nearby college. The Dean and her staff spend much of their time talking to students who plan to go to college. The first thing she said was to work very hard each day in high school. Good grades are most important for being accepted. Being on time for classes and having a good view toward all phases of the school life are two other things to remember."
g = "One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists. According to the study, 'The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.' To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: 'We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average' (Wikipedia)"

j = "The fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an IBM electric. As of 2005, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest English language typist in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Using the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, she had maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, and 170 wpm for shorter periods, with a peak speed of 212 wpm. Blackburn, who failed her QWERTY typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak keyboard in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career. She appeared on Late Night with David Letterman on January 24, 1985, but felt that Letterman made a spectacle of her. Blackburn died in April 2008. (Wikipedia)"
k = "Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization."
l = "The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps his or her eyes on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row."

o = "A freelancer or freelance worker, is a term commonly used for a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work. While the term 'independent contractor' would be used in a higher register of English to designate the tax and employment classes of this type of worker, the term freelancing is most common in culture and creative industries and this term specifically motions to participation therein. Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include: music, writing, acting, computer programming, web design, graphic design, translating and illustrating, film and video production and other forms of piece work which some cultural theorists consider as central to the cognitive-cultural economy."
p = "Many touch typists also use keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the Ctrl key plus the S key to save a document as they type, or the Ctrl key plus the Z key to undo a mistake. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the Backspace key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes."

When you're in a situation where the people in your life aren't helping you to feel better about yourself, this can become a problem in your day to day life. Most insecurity stems from feelings of not being attractive or feelings of loneliness. If your insecurity doesn't necessarily stem from a lack of interaction, but more a lack of feeling attractive, there are other options that will help you online. Sometimes the best way to put your insecurities to rest can simply be to get an honest opinion. There are multiple support groups online where you can share a picture of yourself with other members and they will give honest feedback on your appearance. In most cases, they will point out good qualities that you may have missed in yourself. But you can trust them to be honest and many members give very valuable style and posture advice to increase your attractiveness. These practical tips and unbiased opinions from supportive strangers will immediately help you feel better about yourself, and if the tips are implemented it will also improve your self-esteem in the long-run."

x = "Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are 'Farmer' and 'Hunter'. The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called 'sales capturing'. An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process."
